    Summary:   
      •	22 Years experience in software design, implementation and testing
      •	Experience in C, C++, RTOS, Linux, Windows
      •	Experience in implementing testing tools and testing methodologies
    
    Experience: 
     November 2002 to Present 
     Sierra Design Group / Bally Technologies  / Scientific Games,  Reno, NV
     Senior Firmware Engineer
      •	Responsible for development of slot machine games for the gaming industry
      •	Development environment C++ on an embedded Linux platform, using SlickEdit, CrossVC, and TestTrack tools
      •	Using a Math PAR Sheet, reel strip definitions, graphics files, animation files and sound files to ultimately complete a game
      •	Games could be video reel or stepper motor reel, games controlled thermal ticket printers, cash readers, and other peripherals via communication protocols 
      •	Monitored and contributed to the entire process from software development, Quality Assurance and Testing, to GLI regulatory approval
    
    December 2000 to August 2002
    Calix Networks, Petaluma CA
    Lead Integration Engineer
      Responsibilities include all phases of software and hardware integration for a Telecommunications Access Node
        •	Developed test plans and test cases for DSn and OCn line cards
        •	Created automated TCL and  PERL test scripts for testing of equipment and facility  provisioning, cross-connects, performance monitoring, and alarm reporting
        •	Created TL1 scripts for control-plane simulation and testing prior to hardware availability
        •	Performed hardware/software system integration and data-plane testing using OmniBer, TBerd, and AdTech test equipment 
        •	Developed software for a Test Access and Alarm Display Unit, including ISRs, boot code, and application code
    
    July 2000 to December 2000
    Texas Instruments, Santa Rosa CA
    Software Engineer
